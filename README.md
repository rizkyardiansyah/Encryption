Encryption
==========

Encrypt your text with MD5. 

When I use JSP, I usually use this class to encrypt a password in database.
In this class, I make method 'encrypt' which the implementation equal with MD5 on MySQL.
So, if you are building a website. You can use this class to encrypt user's password.
